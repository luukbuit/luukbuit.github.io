## Introduction

This is a limited and opinionated approach to test automation.

- The only programming language used is Java (with a bit of SQL).
- The scope is limited to web applications with a REST API and a relational database (for now).
- Tools and libraries work well together.
- Test code is clear, consistent and maintainable.
- Beautiful test reports are important.
- Domain experts do not write tests.

Why?

Imagine that you are a test automation engineer in a project with a Java backend. Domain experts are deeply involved, but not interested in writing test specifications: that is your job. You really like to involve stakeholders with nice test reports. The developers in your team are fluent in Java and not interested losing themselves in tools like FitNesse or Robot framework.

If you are not afraid to improve your Java skills, and if you like to work together with the developers in your team on the test automation tasks, why not go Java all the way? The tools are perfect, the libraries well maintained, the test reports beautiful, and you can work on it with the whole team. 

What about Cucumber?

If you have domain experts who want to write feature files in Gherkin syntax, then you are really lucky. In that case it is definitely a good choice to invest in coding Cucumber step definitions. If you do not have such domain experts, adding Cucumber to your project is just overhead.
